epitope))),,,,,MRO:traceable-author-statement,inferred MHC restriction based on traceable author statement,subclass,inferred MHC restriction,traceable author statement,,Cited reference,MHC restriction determined by an author's statement that the restriction of the epitope was already known prior to their publication.,IEDB,"The description of the peptide as being ""a well-characterized H-2-IAg7 restricted epitope"" in a publication resulted in this belief."MRO:evidence-from-mhc-ligand-assay,inferred MHC restriction based on MHC ligand assay,subclass,inferred MHC restriction,experimental evidence,MHC ligand assay,MHC binding assay,MHC restriction determined by a positive outcome in a MHC ligand assay.,IEDB,The epitope was believed to be HLA-A*02:03 restricted because it bound HLA-A*02:03 with high affinity in an assay where the peptide concentration inhibiting 50% of the specific binding to the MHc molecule was measured.MRO:evidence-from-single-mhc-available-in-t-cell-assay,inferred MHC restriction based on single MHC available in T cell assay,subclass,inferred MHC restriction,experimental evidence,T cell  epitope recognition assay,T cell assay -Single MHC type present,MHC restriction determined by a positive outcome in a T cell assay where the antigen presenting cell (or tetramer/multimer) expressed only a single MHC molecule.,IEDB,"Because the T cells proliferated in reponse to epitope loaded APC expressing only BoLA-DRB3*1201, the epitope was inferred to be BoLA-DRB3*1201 restricted."MRO:evidence-from-set-of-mhc--available-in-t-cell-assay,inferred MHC restriction based on set of MHC  available in T cell assay,subclass,inferred MHC restriction,experimental evidence,T cell  epitope recognition assay,T cell assay -MHC subset identification,MHC restriction determined by the reduction or loss of a positive outcome in a T cell assay when subsets of MHC bearing APC were blocked.,IEDB,The loss of T cell response when anti-DR antibody was added to the assay resulted in the belief that the antigen is DR restricted.MRO:evidence-from-pattern-of-reactivity-of-same-t-cells-with-different-mhc-in-t-cell-assay,inferred MHC restriction based on pattern of reactivity of same T cells with different MHC in T cell assay,subclass,inferred MHC restriction,experimental evidence,T cell  epitope recognition assay,T cell assay -Mismatched MHC molecules,MHC restriction determined by a positive outcome in a T cell assay when APC expressing specific MHC were used and a negative response with APC not expressing the specific MHC.,IEDB,The epitope was determined to be Patr-B*02:01 restricted when APC expressing Patr-B*02:01 caused T cells to produce cytokines and APC lacking this molecule resulted in no cytokine response.MRO:evidence-from-type-of-effector-t-cell-utilized-in-t-cell-assay,inferred MHC restriction based on type of effector T cell utilized in T cell assay,subclass,inferred MHC restriction,experimental evidence,T cell  epitope recognition assay,T cell assay -T cell subset identification,MHC restriction determined by a positive outcome in a T cell assay using specific T cell subsets as effector cells or by a negative outcome when a spceific subset is blocked by antibodies.,IEDB,"Because a T cell response was only detectable with CD8+ T cells and not CD4+ T cells, the antigen is believed to be MHC Class I restricted."MRO:evidence-from-type-of-biological-process-measured-in-t-cell-assay,inferred MHC restriction based on type of biological process measured in T cell assay,subclass,inferred MHC restriction,experimental evidence,T cell epitope dependent biological activity assay,T cell assay -Biological process measured,MHC restriction determined by a positive outcome in a T cell assay where the response  measured is indicative of a certain T cell subset.,IEDB,The epitope was believed to be Class II restricted because the T cells produced IL-5 when incubated with the epitope.MRO:evidence-from-pattern-of-donor-reactivity-with-different-mhc-in-t-cell-assay,inferred MHC restriction based on pattern of donor reactivity with different MHC in T cell assay,subclass,inferred MHC restriction,experimental evidence,T cell  epitope recognition assay,T cell assay -Statistical association,MHC restriction determined by the association of a positive outcome in a T cell assay with the presence of certain alleles within the responding population.,IEDB,"When all responding T cell donors were found to express HLA-A*02:01, the epitope was presumed to be HLA-A*02:01 restricted."MRO:evidence-from-mhc-binding-prediction,inferred MHC restriction based on MHC binding prediction,subclass,inferred MHC restriction,experimental evidence,T cell  epitope recognition assay,MHC binding prediction,"MHC restriction determined by predictive analysis of the epitope-MHC interaction, based upon the sequence or structure of the epitope without experimental assay.",IEDB,The use of the NetChop prediction software to determine the likely MHC restriction of a peptide.
