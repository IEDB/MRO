MHC chain expression evidence		subclass	evidence	('is about' some ('MHC class I chain' or 'MHC class II chain'))		Evidence about the level of MHC class I or class I chain expression observed in a population.	IEDB		
evidence of MHC chain expression not observed	not observed	subclass	chain expression evidence			A type of chain expression evidence where the chain expression is not observed in the population.			
evidence of MHC chain expression observed	observed	subclass	chain expression evidence			A type of chain expression evidence where the chain expression is observed in the population.			
evidence of MHC chain expression observed in >1% of the population	observed in >1% of the population	subclass	chain expression evidence			A type of chain expression evidence where the chain expression is observed in more than 1% of the population.			
evidence of MHC chain expression questionable	questionable	subclass	chain expression evidence			A type of chain expression evidence where the chain expression is questionable in the population.			
inferred MHC restriction based on MHC binding prediction	MHC binding prediction	subclass	inferred MHC restriction evidence	experimental evidence	assay measuring binding of a T cell epitope:MHC:TCR complex	An inferred MHC restriction determined by predictive analysis of the epitope-MHC interaction, based upon the sequence or structure of the epitope without experimental assay.	IEDB	The use of the NetCTLPan prediction software to determine the likely MHC restriction of a peptide.	
inferred MHC restriction based on MHC ligand assay	MHC binding assay	subclass	inferred MHC restriction evidence	experimental evidence	MHC ligand assay	An inferred MHC restriction determined by a positive outcome in a MHC ligand assay.	IEDB	The epitope was believed to be HLA-A*02:03 restricted because it bound HLA-A*02:03 with high affinity in an assay where the peptide concentration inhibiting 50% of the specific binding to the MHc molecule was measured.	
inferred MHC restriction based on pattern of donor reactivity with different MHC in T cell assay	T cell assay -Statistical association	subclass	inferred MHC restriction evidence	experimental evidence	assay measuring binding of a T cell epitope:MHC:TCR complex	An inferred MHC restriction determined by the association of a positive outcome in a T cell assay with the presence of certain alleles within the responding population.	IEDB	When all responding T cell donors were found to express HLA-A*02:01, the epitope was presumed to be HLA-A*02:01 restricted.	
inferred MHC restriction based on pattern of reactivity of same T cells with different MHC in T cell assay	T cell assay -Mismatched MHC molecules	subclass	inferred MHC restriction evidence	experimental evidence	assay measuring binding of a T cell epitope:MHC:TCR complex	An inferred MHC restriction determined by a positive outcome in a T cell assay when APC expressing specific MHC were used and a negative response with APC not expressing the specific MHC.	IEDB	The epitope was determined to be Patr-B*02:01 restricted when APC expressing Patr-B*02:01 caused T cells to produce cytokines and APC lacking this molecule resulted in no cytokine response.	
inferred MHC restriction based on set of MHC  available in T cell assay	T cell assay -MHC subset identification	subclass	inferred MHC restriction evidence	experimental evidence	assay measuring binding of a T cell epitope:MHC:TCR complex	An inferred MHC restriction determined by the reduction or loss of a positive outcome in a T cell assay when subsets of MHC bearing APC were blocked.	IEDB	The loss of T cell response when anti-DR antibody was added to the assay resulted in the belief that the antigen is DR restricted.	
inferred MHC restriction based on single MHC available in T cell assay	T cell assay -Single MHC type present	subclass	inferred MHC restriction evidence	experimental evidence	assay measuring binding of a T cell epitope:MHC:TCR complex	An inferred MHC restriction determined by a positive outcome in a T cell assay where the antigen presenting cell (or tetramer/multimer) expressed only a single MHC molecule.	IEDB	Because the T cells proliferated in reponse to epitope loaded APC expressing only BoLA-DRB3*1201, the epitope was inferred to be BoLA-DRB3*1201 restricted.	
inferred MHC restriction based on traceable author statement	Cited reference	subclass	inferred MHC restriction evidence	author statement supported by traceable reference		An inferred MHC restriction determined by an author's statement that the restriction of the epitope was already known prior to their publication.	IEDB	"The description of the peptide as being ""a well-characterized H-2-IAg7 restricted epitope"" in a publication resulted in this belief."	
inferred MHC restriction based on type of biological process measured in T cell assay	T cell assay -Biological process measured	subclass	inferred MHC restriction evidence	experimental evidence	T cell epitope dependent biological activity assay	An inferred MHC restriction determined by a positive outcome in a T cell assay where the response  measured is indicative of a certain T cell subset.	IEDB	The epitope was believed to be Class II restricted because the T cells produced IL-5 when incubated with the epitope.	
inferred MHC restriction based on type of effector T cell utilized in T cell assay	T cell assay -T cell subset identification	subclass	inferred MHC restriction evidence	experimental evidence	assay measuring binding of a T cell epitope:MHC:TCR complex	An inferred MHC restriction determined by a positive outcome in a T cell assay using specific T cell subsets as effector cells or by a negative outcome when a spceific subset is blocked by antibodies.	IEDB	Because a T cell response was only detectable with CD8+ T cells and not CD4+ T cells, the antigen is believed to be MHC Class I restricted.	
inferred MHC restriction evidence		subclass	evidence	('is about' some ('MHC protein complex' and (bound_to some epitope)))		Evidence about the restriction of some MHC protein complex that is bound to some epitope.	IEDB		Coordination between OBI and ECO is work-in-progress. In OBI, the inferred restriction is modelled as a 'conclusion based on data'.
