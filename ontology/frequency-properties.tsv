CIWD population frequency	"Allele frequency is calculated by dividing the number of times the 'allele' of interest is observed in a population by the total number of copies of all the alleles at that particular genetic locus in the population. The total number of copies is calculated by multiplying the number of individuals times two for all loci except DRB3/4/5. For DRB3/4/5, the number of assignments was used as the total.
