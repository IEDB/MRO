genetic entity		subclass					
MHC locus		subclass	genetic locus		The region of a chromosome that codes for MHC molecules.	IEDB	The class II regions encoding for the DP, DQ, and DR molecules on human chromosome 6.
MHC haplotype		subclass	SO:0001024		A set of MHC alleles that is frequently inherited together.	IEDB	The mouse H-2-k class II haplotype is expressed in C3H mice.
serotype		subclass	information content entity		A pattern of antibody binding associated with certain material entities	IEDB	
MHC serotype		subclass	serotype		A serotype identifying a specific group of MHC molecules.	IEDB	The human  HLA-A3 serotype includes HLA-A*03:01 and HLA-A*03:02.
T cell epitope dependent biological activity assay		subclass	T cell  epitope recognition assay				
MHC ligand assay		subclass	immune epitope assay				
MHC protein complex with haplotype	haplotype	equivalent	protein complex	('haplotype member of' some 'MHC haplotype')	A protein complex that is a member of an MHC haplotype.	IEDB	The mouse H-2-Kk molecule belongs to the H-2-k haplotype.
MHC protein complex with serotype	serotype	equivalent	protein complex	('serotype member of' some 'MHC serotype')	A protein complex that is a member of an MHC serotype.	IEDB	The human HLA-A*03:01 molecule is part of the HLA-A3 serotype.
mutant MHC protein complex	mutant MHC molecule	equivalent	protein complex	('is synthetic protein mutant of' some 'MHC protein complex')	A protein complex in which one or both chains has at least one amino acid residue altered from the wild type sequence.	IEDB	The HLA-B*08:01 B:I66A mutant protein has a single amino acid mutation in the B*08:01 chain at residue 166, where the wild type isoleucine was replaced with an alanine.
