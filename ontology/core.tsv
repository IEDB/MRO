Beta-2-microglobulin locus		subclass	genetic locus		The region of a chromosome that codes for Beta-2-microglobulin molecules.	IEDB	
MHC haplotype		subclass	SO:0001024		A set of MHC alleles that is frequently inherited together.	IEDB	The mouse H-2-k class II haplotype is expressed in C3H mice.
MHC ligand assay		subclass	immune epitope assay				
MHC locus		subclass	genetic locus		The region of a chromosome that codes for MHC molecules.	IEDB	"The class II regions encoding for the DP, DQ, and DR molecules on human chromosome 6."
MHC protein complex with haplotype	haplotype	equivalent	MHC protein complex	('haplotype member of' some 'MHC haplotype')	A protein complex that is a member of an MHC haplotype.	IEDB	The mouse H-2-Kk molecule belongs to the H-2-k haplotype.
MHC protein complex with serotype	serotype	equivalent	MHC protein complex	('serotype member of' some 'MHC serotype')	A protein complex that is a member of an MHC serotype.	IEDB	The human HLA-A*03:01 molecule is part of the HLA-A3 serotype.
MHC serotype		subclass	serotype		A serotype identifying a specific group of MHC molecules.	IEDB	The human  HLA-A3 serotype includes HLA-A*03:01 and HLA-A*03:02.
T cell epitope dependent biological activity assay		subclass	assay measuring binding of a T cell epitope:MHC:TCR complex				
genetic entity		subclass					
haplotype member of					"A relation between a protein complex and a haplotype, in which some parts of the protein complex are encoded by genes in the haplotype."		
has MHC restriction level							
has chain I mutation							
has chain II mutation							
is synthetic protein mutant of					"A relationship between a protein that was designed as a variant and its naturally occurring template protein, where the synthesized variant has one or more defined differences - typically introduced to examine the impact of such variations on protein function."		
mutant MHC protein complex	mutant MHC molecule	equivalent	MHC protein complex	('is synthetic protein mutant of' some 'MHC protein complex')	A protein complex in which one or both chains has at least one amino acid residue altered from the wild type sequence.	IEDB	"The HLA-B*08:01 B:I66A mutant protein has a single amino acid mutation in the B*08:01 chain at residue 166, where the wild type isoleucine was replaced with an alanine."
serotype		subclass	information content entity		A pattern of antibody binding associated with certain material entities	IEDB	
serotype member of					"A relation between a protein complex and a serotype, in which the protein complex belongs to the serotype by virtue of its disposition to bind with certain antibodies."		
MHC gene allele		subclass	genetic entity		A specific form of the MHC gene that encodes for a HLA protein.		
G group		subclass	genetic entity		HLA alleles that have identical nucleotide sequences across the exons encoding the peptide binding domains (exon 2 and exon 3 for class I alleles and exon 2 for class II alleles).
