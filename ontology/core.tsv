MRO:0000000	haplotype member of	owl:ObjectProperty					A relation between a protein complex and a haplotype, in which some parts of the protein complex are encoded by genes in the haplotype.		
MRO:0000001	serotype member of	owl:ObjectProperty					A relation between a protein complex and a serotype, in which the protein complex belongs to the serotype by virtue of its disposition to bind with certain antibodies.		
MRO:0000002	is synthetic protein mutant of	owl:ObjectProperty					A relationship between a protein that was designed as a variant and its naturally occurring template protein, where the synthesized variant has one or more defined differences - typically introduced to examine the impact of such variations on protein function.		
MRO:0000004	MHC gene	owl:Class		subclass	gene		The region of a chromosome that codes for MHC molecules.	IEDB	The class II regions encoding for the DP, DQ, and DR molecules on human chromosome 6.
MRO:0000005	MHC haplotype	owl:Class		subclass	SO:0001024		A set of MHC alleles that is frequently inherited together.	IEDB	The mouse H-2-k class II haplotype is expressed in C3H mice.
MRO:0000006	serotype	owl:Class		subclass	information content entity		A pattern of antibody binding associated with certain material entities	IEDB	
MRO:0000007	MHC serotype	owl:Class		subclass	serotype		A serotype identifying a specific group of MHC molecules.	IEDB	The human  HLA-A3 serotype includes HLA-A*03:01 and HLA-A*03:02.

MRO:0000010	MHC protein complex with haplotype	owl:Class	haplotype	equivalent	MHC protein complex	('haplotype member of' some 'MHC haplotype')	A protein complex that is a member of an MHC haplotype.	IEDB	The mouse H-2-Kk molecule belongs to the H-2-k haplotype.
MRO:0000011	MHC protein complex with serotype	owl:Class	serotype	equivalent	MHC protein complex	('serotype member of' some 'MHC serotype')	A protein complex that is a member of an MHC serotype.	IEDB	The human HLA-A*03:01 molecule is part of the HLA-A3 serotype.
MRO:0000012	mutant MHC protein complex	owl:Class	mutant MHC molecule	equivalent	MHC protein complex	('is synthetic protein mutant of' some 'MHC protein complex')	A protein complex in which one or both chains has at least one amino acid residue altered from the wild type sequence.	IEDB	The HLA-B*08:01 B:I66A mutant protein has a single amino acid mutation in the B*08:01 chain at residue 166, where the wild type isoleucine was replaced with an alanine.
